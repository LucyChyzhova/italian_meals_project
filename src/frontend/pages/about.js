            <p>My name is Lucy and I'm crazy about what I'm doing now. It's all about design and coding.
             I feel so powerful, just think, I started from scratch and then this full backend and frontend stuff. 
             I don't want to list all programs and languages... BUT I will do it. 
             Here I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PostMan, and Node.js. I guess, there is still a room for improvement, but I just started :) </p>
